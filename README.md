Shinobi is the Open Source CCTV platform written in Node.JS. Designed with multiple account system, Streams by WebSocket, and Save to WebM. Shinobi can record IP Cameras and Local Cameras.

Yes. I am saying it's **the** platform. It will hopefully be revered like WordPress and Magento in their respective sectors... Hopefully better.
