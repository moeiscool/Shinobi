# What others say

> "After trying zoneminder without success (heavy unstable and slow) I passed to Shinobi that despite being young spins a thousand times better (I have a setup with 16 cameras recording in FHD to ~ 10fps on a pentium of ~ 2009 and I turn with load below 1.5)."

> "I would suggest Shinobi as a NVR. It's still in the early days but works a lot better than ZoneMinder for me. I'm able to record 16 cams at 1080p 15fps continously whith no load on server (Pentium E5500 3GB RAM) where zm crashed with 6 cams at 720p. Not to mention the better interface."
